The repository contains the materials, including data and codes, we need for the course of Business Analytics by Dr. Zhang.
The files with ".csv" are the dataset we used for data analysis (click_csv for regression and images_for_logit for logit). All the data were generated randomly by Dr. Zhang only for the purpose of this course.
The files with ".ipynb"  are the codes that can run by Jupyter Notebook.
The file "slides_xz" is the PPT slides used for class on April 11, 2025.
